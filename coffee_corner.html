        <p>A place for me to share my coffee related chronicles. Notes on different brew methods, exciting recent caffeinated adventures, and what I'm looking forwards to in the future. This page is definitely not for everyone and I'm absolutely a  complete amateur. Feel free to email me recommendations or tips & tricks!</p>

        <h4>09/30/2024:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Is there shame in tossing perfectly good coffee?</li>
            <li>I'm incredibly tired of the ALDIs Guatemalan but I can't justify throwing it out</li>
            <li>Side tangent:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I've never had a good drink from an on campus Starbucks</li>
                <li>Never and I always fall for their trap</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>09/29/2024:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Camping Coffee Session</li>
            <li>Went camping with my family at Clinton Lake very nice</li>
            <li>Brewed coffee using a triangular pour-over setup</li>
            <li>Starbucks French Roast</li>

        <h4>09/26/2024:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>This was day two of ALDIs Guatemalan Coffee</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I think I understand it now</li>
                <li>I like it more than the Honduran beans</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Perfect Moccamaster operation this morning</li>
        <li>I get headaches when I wake up until I have coffee now</li>

        <h4>09/25/2024:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A human error & analysis:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Coffee grounds were added to the filter holder without the filter being in place</li>
                <li>Upon realization of the error, measures were taken to minimize spread of damage</li>
                <li>Primary impact was a delayed cup of coffee and an erosion of my faith in my pre-caffinated brain </li>
                <li>A catch-22 scenario: only a person who is fully awake can perform the steps in the correct order however it is impossible to fully wake up without first performing the steps and brewing coffee</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Steps Moving Forwards:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>After the disappointing and frankly embarrassing situation this morning, many on the board are calling on me to resign</li>
                <li>I believe i'm still the best fit for the role (of brewing my morning cup of coffee) and will commit myself to the future of the program</li>
                <li>I pledge a 10 day no mistake period</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <ul>
        <li>This morning, the air was crisp and the coffee grinder called my name, urging me to feed it<ul>
        <li>I transferred 8 tablespoons into his hopper, satisfying his hunger</li>
        <li>In a game time decision, the grind setting was moved from 14 to 10, with a contract to buy back at 14 tomorrow if results weren’t satisfactory </li>
        <li>Double or nothing will also be discussed by the board in the event of an excellent cup</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Honduras is a cool country I went there when I was little <ul>
        <li>ALDIs also went there snd they came back with a medium roast single origin bag of whole beans which I bought from them at their store</li>
        <li>Ethical considerations ALDIs takes? <ul>
        <li>I’d like to know - I’m curious </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Practical:<ul>
        <li>I’m bumping up coffee intake to 5 cups minimum to receive maximum caffeine benefits </li>
        <li>Plans in the works for tasting every espresso in Lawrence </li>
        <li>Personification of objects in Coffee Corner is here to stay<ul>
        <li>Tomorrow I’m going to say I got into an argument with the Dunkin donut medium roast that’s in my drawer</li>

        <h4>09/23/2024:</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>I measured hit water and grounds the night  before</li>
        <li>All I had to do in the morning was flip a switch and the aromas were oh so nice</li>
        <li>Last bit of my Sumatra coffee <ul>
        <li>Next plan is finish off Honduras aldi beans </li>
        <li>My dad liked the Honduran beans which surprised me</li>

        <h4>09/22/2024:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Went out for breakfast and had a cappuccino</li>
            <li>I'm just not a cappuccino guy I fear</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Too milky not enough taste</li>
                <li>Milk was overly foamy</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The restaurant had a nice ambiance</li>
            <li>Should've gotten an espresso instead</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>09/21/2024:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Used my parent's Breville Grind Control Machine </li>
            <ul>
                <li>It's the same price as my Moccamaster</li>
                <li>While it has more features than the Moccamaster, it is not SCA approved</li>
                <li>I suspect it has an immersion component in which the water is soaking in the filter holder </li>
                <li>It seems to do a solid job at brewing</li>
                <li>I can't trust the build in grinder and I suspect it's less nice than Encore(??)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Also used their Bartza Encore grinder</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Ground some of my Simply Organic Honduran Origin beans</li>
                <li>Grind Setting: 14</li>
                <li>4 TBSP of whole bean, didn't measure difference in whole bean and ground product</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Not sure I'm a fan of these beans</li>
            <li>Possibly too light, despite being labeled as a medium roast</li>
            <li>Almost a weird, vegetable taste buried in it?</li>
            <li>Not bad enough to not finish but likely won't be buying again</li>
            <ul>
                <li>From the perspective of being ALDIs $5.00 beans they aren't unreasonable</li>
                <li>Still excited for my other ALDI beans these were the least liked ones by the internet</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Technivorm Moccamaster KBGV Select has been purchased!</h4>
        <p>I did it! I ordered one of the internet's highest reviewed drip coffee makers: the Moccamaster KBGV Select. It cost me just under $400 after tax which is about 333% of my biweekly paycheck (i.e. it would take around 1.5 months to recoup the money if I cared). I couldn't care less! Money will always ebb and flow&ndash;like the tide&ndash;however I'm planning to use the Moccamaster for at least a year and it could easily last 10+ years (some redditiors have reported 20 years of use). It also is covered by a 5 year warranty out of the box. Moccamaster machines are hand assembled in Norway and in my humble&ndash;objective&ndash;opinion, the KBGV Select is the best looking non-espresso coffee making implement on the market right now. The design is timeless, functional, and they sell it in a bunch of colors (I got Yellow Pepper!). It isn't some ordinary drip coffee maker, which is probably what makes most people think of it as an unreasonable purchase. No, the Moccamaster KBGV Select is a Specialty Coffee Association <em>approved</em> home brewer. This is an <a href="https://sca.coffee/certified-home-brewer">exclusive list</a>, requiring adherence to standards regarding extraction, brewing temperature, hotplate temperatures, and brewing time to name a few. </p>
