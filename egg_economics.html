        <h3>Current Egg Prices!</h3>
        <p>Eggs. I don't even fucking like fucking eggs. They smell weird, they'll be soggy and if they aren't soggy then thy're cold and slimy. I don't like cold and slimy things like Trump, Musk, People that Vote Over EGGS. </p>
        <p>WHAT THE FUCK. Are you fucking kidding me???? We lost the FUCKING ELECTION OVER EGGGGSSSSSS???????</p>
        <p>What the fuck guys! What the gobbeldy-gluckedy-FUCK is it abut EGGS that caused people to vote for Trump's slimy smelly ass? </p>
        <p>...  cue The New York Times. The Washington Post. The New Yorker. "Dems lost the election because of the economy." Dems lost the elections because groceries were too expensive. Dems lost the election because EGGS WERE SO FUCKING GOD DAMN EXPENSIVE. </p>
        <p>What the fuck does that mean?? No&mdash;seriously. What does it mean? How can an egg be expensive it's a fucking egg. A chicken will shit five of those things out every hour? What the fuck are you doing? Paying the chicken?? Does the chicken have to buy a house in America? In this economy? The chicken's food is free! Chicken: You have two jobs: eat and shit out eggs. HOW EXPENSIVE WERE THE EGGS??????? Wait. How? Expensive? Were? They??? (I genuiently don't know because i don't go to grocery stores). Were they more than one dollar? Be honest...! Were they over 50 cents? Like 50 cents is only one quarter. Just pay it man! It aint' gon kill you!</p>
        <p>There IS NOT a bird flu! How the hell do birds get the flu? Are they dumb or something? Can't they fly away from the fucking germs. Bitch FLY! You ain't even indoors!!</p>
