            <p class="intro">None of the app ideas you are about to see will ever work. I'm not a pessimist, I'm a realist. Obviously I wish that they would work. If they did, I'd quit my job as a line cook at Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers and drop out of school in an instant to do full time app development. These ideas can't possibly be profitable and learning about them is a waste of time for you. I'm going to write about them because thats the only thing that they're good for. They aren't profitable.</p>
