            <h2>The Downtown District & Business</h2>

            <p>My family moved to Lawrence when I was thirteen for work (no, not <em>my</em> work). I still live here and the city is in luck because I'm ready to help!</p>

            <p>I'd like to paint my readers a scene. My analysts tell me 100% of my readership (thank you mom and dad) live inside of Lawrence but the other 0% would surely appreciate a brief outline of our fair city. Lawrence, Kansas sits in north-eastern Kansas, a 45 minute drive from Kansas City. Our population is around 100k. Separating Lawrence from other similar-sized cities in Kansas is the University of Kansas (KU), the state's flagship public university. The university's presence can be felt throughout the city, I'll provide necessary context as I go. The city is contained within an area of about five miles by fifteen miles. A large reservoir-lake, <em>Clinton Lake</em>, sits in the south-west corner. The downtown district is a historic ten block stretch along one street: Massachusets Street. Directly west of Massachusets Street are historic neighborhoods and slightly south of these neighborhoods is the university. West of the university devolves into sprawling suburbs which extend further west, stopping at Clinton Lake.</p>

            <p>Lawrence is no slouch. A blue bubble in a decidedly red state, liberalism is alive and well. The university is a hub of higher-education and the city's physical location between the state capital and Kansas City leaves plenty of doors open for opportunity. There are plenty of historic and beautiful structures in the downtown area. The surrounding countryside is scenic. Lawrence has smart people, money, beauty, what more could a city ask for? I want to use this series to focus on a couple specific issues which I think could make Lawrence a significantly better place to live, if not for everybody, for people like me.</p>

            <p>Massachusets Street is losing its charm&ndash;fast. It's an example of what happens when a city stops treating a core district with respect: as residents move into houses in neighborhoods which don't rely on the area (and choose to ignore it), Lawrence's historic downtown, unsupported and neglected, devolves into the shell-like setting of countless midwestern towns. I've identified a distinctive discrepancy between Lawrence's and <em>the rest of Kansas's</em> declining central business districts: the population of Lawrence is still increasing. Lawrence's population <b>is not</b> declining, or even stagnating! Our population and median income are both increasing steadily into 2024. What should be perfect conditions for a lively, growing downtown have resulted in a sad skeleton of what should be.</p>

            <p>Whose fault? I began by considering supply and demand principles. Downtown cannot supply what residents want so it recedes. A perfect free market justification: nobodies fault, the market simply wasn't receptive. WRONG! Far from a free market, the local housing market is pushing homes further and further westward. The sprawling developments are so out of control that homes are being constructed <b>15 minutes</b> from downtown Lawrence. A fifteen minute drive in a town of <em>barely</em> 100k is absolutely unacceptable. The City of Lawrence should grow a spine and cut them loose; they no longer align with our goals.</p>

            <p>Communities of low-density new developments containing curving, meandering roads; more asphalt than grass; and a distinctive absence of trees are <b>not</b> cities. They are <b>suburbs</b>. A suburb should be politically and economically separate from its city&ndash;two different entities, it's important to make sure neither subsidizes either.</p>
