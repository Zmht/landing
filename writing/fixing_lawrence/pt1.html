            <p>My family moved to Lawrence when I was thirteen for work (no, not <em>my</em> work). I still live here and the city is in luck because I'm ready to help!</p>

            <p>I'd like to paint my readers a scene. My analysts tell me 100% of my readership (thank you mom and dad) live inside of Lawrence but the other 0% would surely appreciate a brief outline of our fair city. Lawrence, Kansas sits in north-eastern Kansas, a 45 minute drive from Kansas City. Our population is around 100k. Separating Lawrence from other similar-sized cities in Kansas is the University of Kansas (KU), the state's flagship public university. The university's presence can be felt throughout the city, I'll provide necessary context as I go. The city is contained within an area of about five miles by fifteen miles. A large reservoir-lake, <em>Clinton Lake</em>, sits in the south-west corner. The downtown district is a historic ten block stretch along one street: Massachusets Street. Directly west of Massachusets Street are historic neighborhoods and slightly south of these neighborhoods is the university. West of the university devolves into sprawling suburbs which extend further west, stopping at Clinton Lake.</p>

            <p>Lawrence is no slouch. A blue bubble in a decidedly red state, liberalism is alive and well. The university is a hub of higher-education and the city's physical location between the state capital and Kansas City leaves plenty of doors open for opportunity. There are plenty of historic and beautiful structures in the downtown area. The surrounding countryside is scenic. Lawrence has smart people, money, beauty, what more could a city ask for?</p>

            <p>It's so hard to say. I've tried and tried to </p>
