                <figcaption>Study for 'Old Mortality' by David Wilkie (1785-1841)</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p><em>My mortality and I have a mutual understanding.</em></p>
            <p><em>I may ignore him without consequence and therefore I am immortal.</em></p>

            <p>However, this <em>is</em> merely an emulation. Nothing is immortal and no emulation is perfectly accurate. It's more accurate to describe myself as halfway between immortal and mortal. I consider my situation similar to how light can be described as a wave or a particle. As a particle, light's position is ambiguous but its energy is discrete. As a wave, light diffracts and interferes but has momentum like a particle. Abstractly, I believe that the most accurate way to describe myself is through a duality. It is deeper than my emulation, which allows me to justify decisions which a mortal man wouldn't be able to justify. Not that these decisions are unique. I make the same decisions as everyone else but I think that the way I arrive at my decisions could be unique.</p>

            <p>It is only as an immortal being that I personally can consider the future and understand long-term commitments. If I was perfectly mortal I would have no justification for the delay of satisfaction. If I thought mortality was the only force to apply to me, I would act on any and every impulse. I would desperately claw my way through life, taking what I desired, maximizing every experience, milking the world of all it has to offer me and leaving nothing. What does the world have to offer a human?
                <ul>
                    <li>Love</li>
                    <li>Beauty</li>
                    <li>Humour</li>
                    <li>Wonder</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Could a 100% immortal man appreciate <em>any</em> of this? I would argue that only a mortal could understand these concepts. Immortals don't need our world's offerings. They have their immortality and that knowledge is a satisfaction none of unknown to a mortal <em>(mere mortal)</em>.</p>

            <p>Eight billion people live here and my location: somewhere between mortal and immortal is still unique. I'm not sure where that position is. I only know that it does exist and it has to exist on that line. </p>

            <p>It's fascinating to me that my entire <em>state</em> can be described by a singular point on a one dimensional line. A 6th grader could perfectly mathematically model me.</p>

                <figcaption>Graphical representation of my existence</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Where can I move from this line? This line of reasoning: should it fill me with despair? Should I try to modify my position on this line further, perhaps I can leave the line altogether? What if my position is also the intersection between my mortality-immortality line and another line? I'm not going to leave my position and I'm not going to try to change. If I wasn't comfortable with my mortality-immortality position, the severity of its impact on my life would be crushing, immobilizing. I do still recognize it's impact on my life, on many experiences.</p>

            <p>Design is something I care deeply about and I think it has a unique access port into my brain. Beautiful design can reach me at any time&mdash;I'm more mentally available for a given beautiful design than for any person in my life. This is a true relationship which I have with design. Unfortunately, it is a one-sided relationship. I've never been able to design beauty. In my attempts at UI/UX, art, and decorating, I always fall short of beauty (landing squarely at hideous).</p>

            <p>Design's intersections with mortality and immortality contribute to it's magnetic draw on my attention. My mortality is fascinated by design however so is my immortality. I think that this suggests something magical about design, a way that some designs defy boundaries between physical and spiritual.</p>

            <p>An excellent design is immortal? An excellent design may genuinely live forever. I love to imagine this: a beautiful design which is truly (geometrically, physically, artistically) beautiful will be beautiful for <em>the rest of humanity</em>. Will anything else last this long? </p>
