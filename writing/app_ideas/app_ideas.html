            <h1>Free App Ideas!</h1>
            <h2>They Will Never Work</h2>
            <p>by Zachary Hansen Terry</p>
            <p>September 12, 2024</p>

            <p>None of the app ideas you are about to see will ever work. I'm not a pessimist, I'm a realist. <strong>Obviously</strong> I wish that they would work! If they did, I'd quit my job as a line cook at Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers, drop out of school, and spend every waking moment developing them. These ideas cannot possibly be profitable and reading this to learn about them is a waste of time for you. I'm going to write about them because thats the only thing that they're good for. They aren't profitable. That's why they're useless. To prove I actually believe these will never work, I'm gonna provide any half finished source code that I have from the ones I started developing and encourage you to take it no strings attached, finish and publish it. YOU MAY DISREGARD ANY COPYRIGHTS IN THE SOURCE CODE I'VE ATTACHED TO THIS ARTICLE. It is 100% yours now!</p>

            <h3>1. Tech Help Now!</h3>

            <p>Old people <strong>cannot</strong> use technology. They can't help it. They are past the age of learning and only view it with confusion and distrust. They do not want to use technology but they need to participate in society. So they need to connect their Alexa to the internet to listen to music. They have to print out a picture of their grandchild on the swing set(in color). They need to take the videos that are saved to their digital camera (which is absolutely lower quality than their phone), put them on their computer, then email them to their friends.</p>
            
            <p>Makes me roll my eyes... I could do that in like 30 seconds. The concept of Tech Help Now: old people pay young people to help them with their technology. The old people will be the clients and young people will apply to offer their services. <em>At a price.</em> I take a cut of the price since I'm providing a service too: Tech Help Now connects clients to solutions. It's the match maker. Since old people don't trust kids theres a review system. The kids get graded on their work. They also don't get paid until after they prove they fixed the problem. </p>
            
            <p>Isn't it a great idea? Theres lots of apps that connect clients and solutions. Uber, AirBnB, Craigslist, DoorDash, all their competitors. I thought it was a good idea. I made it. Well... I started on it. I gave up since it Will Never Work.</p>

            <h4>Issues:</h4>
            <p><strong>Nobody trusts anyone</strong>. Naturally, old people don't trust kids but the kids are actually just as vulnerable. This platform would be a honeypot of scamming. Left and right people taking money from each other, lying about completion, lying about getting scammed, lying about everything. There's no way any work would get done they'd be too busy lying and cheating.</p>

            <p>It's unfair to blame everything on users. That's just a design restraint and a good developer should be able to work inside of a design restraint. A community of trust could be created given enough time, capital, and participants. There are more problems. Kids don't even know how to use technology. The fact is halfway through development I realized that I (and probably most of this website's visitors) posses <em>above</em> average technology skills and as a whole Generation-Z can be considered tech-illiterate. Google Docs destroyed what should have been the most technically savvy generation ever. Even though Tech Help Now would self-select brighter individuals, it may not be enough. Some problems would be impossible to solve. What should clients do then? Even if they don't have to pay for a non solved solution, it would be an incredibly frustrating waste of time.</p>

            <p>What an awful app it would be. I cannot imagine using it. Tech support is free online anyway. Apple has AppleCare, you can call Microsoft Support regarding your windows laptop, Nintendo Support for when your Nintendo Switch OLED starts acting up. They are all more specialized, free, have chains of escalation which you can use, and have already existed as the norm for decades.</p>

            <h3>2. alBUMs</h3>
            <p>Social media was a great invention. We're all enamoured by it because it's great. It's so awesome to use social media that people are literally addicted. I would <em>love</em> to make an app so good that it physically addicts people. For one, the profit is unlimited. Just wait until you have a large enough user base then sell your ad space. Instagram adds more and more ads and we complain and then we open Instagram anyways. Social media could have grave implications for the future of society but in the meantime it has implications of profit. alBUMs was going to be social media for music. Specifically: collectors that like to listen to an entire album in one sitting. </p>

            <p>I wanted people to listen to an album and then add it to their "collection". They can give it a rating of 1-5 stars, write a short review, select friends that they would recommend it to, and have an aesthetic representation of their physical album collection to use for bragging purposes. There would also be a "wishlist" gallery and moving a album from your wishlist to your collection would be a satisfying action.</p>

            <p>If I could addict people to this app I'd be so rich! Lots of addictive and dopamine producing actions were considered: 
                <ul>
                    <li>3D animation when tapping on an action</li>
                    <li>Haptic feedback</li>
                    <li>Warm colors that wouldn't wera on the eyes</li>
                    <li>Star rating system</li>
                    <li>Galleries to save music to for your return</li>
                    <li>Naturally competitive interactions with friends</li>
                    <li>Album sharing which would mean notifications</li>
                    <li>Simple design which would easy to maneuver.</li>
                    <li>Having every single album you could think of</li>
                    <li>HIGH quality album art (800x800 pixel resolution is irresponsible resource usage but amazing quality when used as a thumbnail in a grid)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h4>Issues</h4>
            <p>Another doomed idea. AUDIOPHILES ARE OLD. Old people seem to be a common theme in my failures. What did I do to them?? Seriously, look at this graph: 
                <figure>
                    <img src="record_demograph.png" alt="Records are primarily bought by old people.">
                    <figcaption>Audiophile Archive Grading & Grading Services (2022)</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </p>

            <p>80 percent of record collectors are above 25. Everyone knows that they don't get addicted to social media. They didn't grow up with it in the same way as Generation-Z. They might as well be immune. I can't monetize an app who's users check in with it every couple weeks. Five ad views per day isn't paying the bills. A social media app full of people who don't know <em>how</em> to be social virtually is doomed.
