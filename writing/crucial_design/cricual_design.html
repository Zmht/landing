            <h1 style="font-size: 2.5em;">Excellent Design is Crucial for the Mortal Man</h1>
            <h2>An Abstract Case for Beauty</h2>

            <p><em>My mortality and I have a mutual understanding.</em></p>
            <p><em>I truly believe that I can ignore him without consequence and therefore I am immortal.</em></p>

            <p>However, this <em>is</em> merely an emulation. Nothing is immortal and no emulation is perfectly accurate. It's more accurate to describe myself as halfway between immortal and mortal. I consider my situation similar to how light can be described as a wave or a particle. As a particle, light's position is ambiguous but its energy is discrete. As a wave, light diffracts and interferes but has momentum like a particle. Abstractly, I believe that the most accurate way to describe myself is through a duality. It is deeper than my emulation, which allows me to justify decisions which a mortal man wouldn't be able to justify. Not that these decisions are unique. I make the same decisions as everyone else but I think that the way I arrive at my decisions could be unique.</p>

            <p>It is only as an immortal being that I personally can consider the future and understand long-term commitments. If I was perfectly mortal I would have no justification for the delay of satisfaction. If I thought mortality was the only force to apply to me, I would act on any and every impulse. I would desperately claw my way through life, taking what I desired, maximizing every experience, milking the world of all it has to offer me and leaving nothing. What does the world have to offer a human?
                <ul>
                    <li>Love</li>
                    <li>Beauty</li>
                    <li>Humour</li>
                    <li>Wonder</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Could a 100% immortal man appreciate <em>any</em> of this? I would argue that only a mortal could understand these concepts. Immortals don't need our world's offerings. They have their immortality and that knowledge is a satisfaction none of these excuses can beat.</p>

            <p>Eight billion people live here and my location: somewhere between mortal and immortal is still unique. I'm not sure where that position is. I only know that it does exist and it has to exist on that line. </p>

            <p>It's fascinating to me that my entire <em>state</em> can be described by a one dimensional point on a two dimensional line. The line doesn't even have concavity. A 6th grader could perfectly mathematically understand me.</p>
