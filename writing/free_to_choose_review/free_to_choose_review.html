            <p>I found Milton and Rose Friedman's <em>Free to Choose</em> to be an approachable, no-nonsense window into the logical conclusion of the political views a free-market economist should align themselves with. A reality of economics is that crossing the bridge connecting economics to politics means crossing a pitted, unstable bridge which many amateur economists (including myself) are prone to falling from. While the Friedmans do an excellent job in their provisions of counterarguments, timely examples, and  logical appeals, they failed when it came to giving the reader ways to think critically or draw their own conclusions. Their many rhetorical questions are too condescending, almost as if the reader is engaging in a debate with a brick wall.</p>
            
            <p>I'm willing to admit off the bat that my economics knowledge is amateur at best and naïve at worst. However, I do passionately enjoy the subject and the Friedman's book satiated my hunger for a “101” level introduction to economics. My relationship with politics is similar. I enjoy discussing and learning about them from an amateur's perspective; and so, the way that Free to Choose explored intersections in politics and economics felt purpose-built to two of my interests. The crux of the book is this: economic freedom is essential to personal freedom. </p>

            <p>The book starts with a chapter on the power of the price. I was motivated by this concept and the claim which the Friedman's put forth: a price is a mechanism which markets can use to control themselves is incredibly simple yet intriguing. They elaborate by explaining that a price encapsulates three functional arms of an economy: transmission of information, incentive, and distribution of income. The key free-market component in this case is in relation to the efficacy of our prices. Drawing on Adam Smith's <em>The Wealth of Nations</em>, the Friedman's posit that a price is only effective if it is in the context of a voluntary exchange. Interfering with the willingness of an exchange will result in distortions of its market functions (transmission of information, incentive, and distribution of income). Of course, Free to Choose chooses to explore government as an example of such interference, providing the basis for the book's following interactions between politics and economics. </p>

            <p><em>Free to Choose</em> frames governments as obstructions to a price-driven market. They argue that governmental interference in the context of education, healthcare, housing, and social welfare under-performs and that the equivalent free market solutions would always be both more efficient and less invasive of personal freedoms. The second claim seems like a given. One is much more likely to experience heightened senses of individualism when interacting with a free market where firms compete under competition than when interacting with a government monopoly. The first claim required more structuring. The concept presented is that self-interest is enough to guarantee a more efficient service assuming that the self-interested parties are all acting in the same free market system. </p>

            <p>Unfortunately, I'm too wary and distrusting as a reader to enjoy presented political evidence, instead feeling burdened with a responsibility to fact-check. I comprehended the Friedman's claims that the Canadian healthcare system (publicized) is less efficient than the private American system. Clouding their analysis was their omission of discussion of European healthcare systems, which felt glaringly obvious. </p>

            <p>It would be unreasonable to claim that I disagree with all of the Friedman's views—or even a majority. The fact is, many are quite reasonable and it's not hard to justify idealized concepts in which the only losers are greedy members of the bureaucracy and everybody else wins. Of course, idealized scenarios are where economic justifications for political policy truly shine. In a perfect free market for example, yes, I do agree that unions would be unnecessary in the maintenance of a powerful, non-exploited workforce. I think that the same could be said about minimum wage laws: when observed through purely the laws of supply and demand as they apply to a market, they are clunky and </p>
