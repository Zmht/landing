            <p><em>You are inside of an elevator. The elevator doesn't move in any way you've every moved in. You know that it is moving but not in a classical sense.</em> In a classical sense the elevator is stationary. Your speedometer reads zero and the navigation system is silent (all elevators made in the United States after 2024 are equipped with these life saving features). Your movement is better described as psychological; perhaps emotional but make no mistake: this is a scientific phenomena. Maybe the elevator is also moving, its certainly possible&mdash;researchers from the University of Colorado Boulder are conducting studies on the elevator psyche (they just got an exciting new grant from Mitsubishi). Regardless of the elevator's opinions, your current neural trajectory, represented as a vector in mental space is displayed on a screen on one of the elevator walls: \(\langle-4,2,-600,3,0,49\rangle\). You rack your brain and can't think of a time you've seen your neural vector move through more than two dimensions. </p>

            <p>Typically psychological movement science is used as a method of control. While it can be observed using relatively simple equipment (low energy, high frequency wave diffractions), a vector form output in the form of positive or negative integers doesn't translate to an absolute position, only a direction of tensor movement, a force within. The term is <em>mental redirection</em>, a way of changing opinions. The concept operates on the same principles as physical movement: applying a force over time (work), results in a change in energy. Applying a force (represented by a neural vector), to a person works similarly on their psyche.</p>

            <p>Anyways, the multidimensional problem in the elevator is increasingly worrying. At work when you redirect people you work in one dimension at a time. Theory exists for multidimensional redirection but it's unstable and not suitable for the market. Redirection occurs in one dimension, self-direction (all humans had before the breakthrough) occurs in two dimensions. An easily observable phenomenon, these are the neural vectors. A few laws have been established by scholars in regards to neural vectors:</p>
            <p>For a <em>sane</em> and <em>living</em> human with neural vector \(\vec{v}\):</p>
            <ol>
                <li>\(|\mathbf{\vec{v}}| \neq 0\)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>The magnitude of a neural vector is never zero. Opinions change rapidly and always.</em></li>
                </ul>
                <li>\(|\mathbf{\dot{v}}| = \left|\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt}\right| \leq V_{max}\)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>The rate of change of a neural vector is less than or equal to a maximum recorded speed at which comprehension cuts off. Opinions change fast but not infinitely fast.</em></li>
                </ul>
                <li>\(|\mathbf{\ddot{v}}| = \left|\frac{d^2\mathbf{v}}{dt^2}\right| \leq A_{\max}\)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>The speed at which the rate of psychological change itself is changing is less than or equal to a maximum value. Erratics and madmen are examples of this rule being broken.</em></li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <p>You run through the laws in your head: magnitude isn't </p>
            <p>Neural vector \(\mathbf{\vec{r}}\) is the regulation vector. Regulation vectors came into style in the early days of the 2020s, when governments were looking for any </p>
