            <p>Both major 2024 presidential candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, have announced their support for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/11/kamala-harris-no-taxes-tips-trump/">eliminating taxes on tips</a> ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Discussions of pandering and empty promises aside, the societal implications which led to this being a popular policy are repulsive. Tipping culture has long been abused as an unethical pressure applied to restaurant goers by greedy owners and unions. A skewed value system in which carrying plates and taking orders requires additional reward beyond a standard wage. Cloaked behind the guise of being the only way for waiters to earn a living wage, tipping is a result of deeper problems in the restaurant industry and the nonsensical social norms Americans subjugate ourselves to when interacting with services.</p>

            <p>Gratuity culture <em>did not</em> begin in the United States. It was birthed in Tudor England to be used as a reward from a master to his serf for a job done exceptionally well. Over time, it diffused into general English culture and was dragged to America post civil war where it was met with distrust. Seen as an aristocratic mechanism used to enforced social class boundaries, it went against the grain of America's anti-class, democratic ethos. Popular Americans of the industrial revolution age such as Andrew Carnegie, Mark Twain, and John D. Rockefeller, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/11/30/457125740/when-tipping-was-considered-deeply-un-american#:~:text=When%20tipping%20began%20to%20spread,%22offensively%20un%2DAmerican.%22">were all vocal anti-tippers</a>. There was a racial component to tipping: African Americans in the service industry, especially in restaurants and on trains, were not paid, instead they received tips which they were expected to live off of. 100 years later, here we are: the federal minimum wage for tipped workers is <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/minimum-wage/tipped">$2.13/hr.</a> and we as consumers are expected to cover the difference between that and a living wage by tipping.</p>

            <p>This adds a captivating, inescapable aspect to the tip: responsibility. Now, the patrons hold the responsibility of their waiters welfare and salary which leads to an obligation and then becomes a norm. </p>

            <p>With a summary of tipping culture's history and it's place in the restaurant industry, we can begin to deconstruct it. I've broken my critique into three parts: tipping is income redistribution, tipping is entitlement, and waiting is an outdated job.</p>
